## How to use
On the [textbook's website]((https://gabors-data-analysis.com/)), we have detailed discussion of how to set up libraries, get data and code: [Overview of data and code](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/data-and-code/)

To see options for various languages, check out:
1. **R** --  [How to run code in R ](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/howto-r/)
2. **Stata** -- [How to run code in Stata ](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/howto-stata/)

## Status (15 July, 2021)

The [Latest release](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da_case_studies/releases/tag/v0.8.0) `v0.8.0` is available as of 16 July 2021.   
There will be additional bugfixes, edits, and `v1.0.0` expected in September. 

1. **R** -- All code ready. Used for graphs in textbook. An environment with all librariries necessary, as `renv` is now available. 
2. **Stata** -- All code ready. In the lack of native machine learning capabilities, no code for chapters 15,16,17, some limitations for chapter 18. This shall change, once we test the new python link-ups. Only planned for version `v1.1.0` expected late 2021. 
3. **Python**  -- Allmost all codes are ready. Moderate differences to book and R are in ch14-ch17, some additional checks planned. An environment with all librariries necessary, as `pipenv` is now available.  

## Organization
1. Each case study has a separate folder.
2. Within case study folders, codes in different languages are simply stored together. 
3. Data should be downloaded and stored in a separate folder. 

## Code language versions
1. **R** -- We used R 4.0.2. 
2. **Stata** -- We used version 15, allmost all code should work in version 13 up.
3. **Python** -- We used Python 3.8.0.

## Get data
Data is hosted on OSF.io

## Found an error or have a suggestion?
Awesome, we know there are errors and bugs. Or just much better ways to do a procedure.

To make a suggestion, please open a `github issue` here with a title containing the case study name. You may also contact [us directctly](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/contact-us/). Cheers!
